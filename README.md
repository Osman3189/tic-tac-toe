# Tic Tac Toe

#### Steps to think about.

1. There are two players X and O.
2. They both need to take turns making a move.
3. The game needs to register possible winning combinations.
4. If there are no winning combinations then it is a draw.


Created two variables that defines Player One and Player Two.

Created another variable that keeps track of turns.

Attached an event listener to every square by targeting the Class Name '.Box'.

Created a conditional statement that looks all the potential winning combinations and if it  equaled to X or O then targeted the HTML title to highlight who won.

Created an else if statement that states if the turnCounter is === 9 and there are no winners then the HTML title should state that it is a draw.


Created 2 click listeners

1. After every box is clicked it should show X or O through event and targeting the HTML.

2. If player wants to reset the game they don't have to refresh the page, by clicking New Game, the click listener should clear all the boxes.
